My First Ruby Program
=====================

Well not really. I wrote the code in this repo
about a year into my Ruby career, when I was
still very much a Java programmer and only
toying with the lovely little language that would
come to dominate my professional life.

I had thought that all of this was lost forever,
but it turns out I had this old computer in a 
closet and *it* had an even older backup archive.
Of such accidents are archaeological legends made.

The code in this repo is a partial implementation
of a program that I have written in every programming
language that I've ever learned: It simulates the Newtonian
mechanics of particles. In plain English it keeps track
of various point masses, things like the Earth and Sun,
and the gravitational forces between them, calculating
the motions of each numerically. I use this program
as a sort of tenth level "Hello world" project when
I'm learning a new programming language. It's complicated
enough to ensure that you have mastered the basics of the 
language while not being impossibly involved. And, once
you get it working it's fun to see the Earth come back
to its starting point after 365 days.

Do keep in mind that the code here is a momentary
snapshot of work in progress! The code is not
done, it relies on an ancient version of Ruby 
and a C extension that I stopped maintaining
more than a decade ago.

I'm releasing it here for a number of reasons:
1. It's just fun.
1. Some folks asked me to (see previous reason).
1. Mostly though, I want newish Ruby programmers to see that learning a new programming language is a process, a process we all go through. So go ahead and laugh when you look at the code. Laugh at the tabs, at the Java-ish camelCaseMethodNames, at the complete lack of tests and probably a million other things. I'll be laughing with you.
